# weather-dashboard

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
